## Instructions to Set Up and Run the Application Locally

To set up and run the Books REST API locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install required dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory to store your MongoDB connection string.
   - Add the MongoDB connection string to the `.env` file as follows:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Start the application by running the following command:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - Access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Test the API:**
   - To test the API endpoints, run `npm run test` using Mocha and supertest. Ensure the API is running before testing.

## Assumptions and Decisions

- Custom Incremental `_id`: We implemented custom incremental `_id` values for books by managing a separate counter collection.
- Error Handling: The API includes basic error handling, but it can be extended with more detailed error messages and codes.
- Security: This documentation doesn't cover security measures like authentication and authorization, which should be added for production readiness.
- Database Choice: The application uses MongoDB as the database. Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual connection string.
